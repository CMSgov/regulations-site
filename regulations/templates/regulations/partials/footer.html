    <p>The CMS Regulations tool is an editorial compilation of material and not
        an official legal edition of the Code of Federal Regulations or the
        Federal Register. We have made every effort to ensure the material
        presented in this tool is accurate, but if you are relying on it for
        legal research you should consult the official editions of those sources
        to confirm your findings. Nothing in this tool binds CMS or creates any
        rights, benefits, or defenses, substantive or procedural, that are
        enforceable by any party in any manner.</p>
